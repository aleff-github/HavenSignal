# Handoff Version

Version: 0.3
Prepared: 2026-08-26

This handoff consolidates:

- the completed project security questionnaire;
- later clarifications made after the questionnaire;
- the current Python/Django implementation direction;
- unresolved security decisions that must not be silently guessed by Codex.

Version 0.2 additionally incorporates:

- non-resurrectable live-replicated Report-DEK/Response-DEK policy;
- explicit Application Administrator and Infrastructure / Key Custodian trust roles;
- Reporter Gateway capability restrictions;
- idempotent `FINALIZING` protocol;
- durable pre-action audit receipts and truncation detection;
- protected operator notes outside permanent audit;
- persisted lease generation/fencing;
- action-bound step-up authorization;
- explicit requirement IDs and traceability for recovery, response, export, CAPTCHA, file sandbox/CDR, roles, keys, alerts, and finalization.

Version 0.3 additionally incorporates exact proposals for:

- WebAuthn MFA, action-bound step-up, and credential lifecycle;
- original-report cryptography and Key Service destructive acceptance;
- Emergency Export packaging, encryption, signature, and delivery;
- hostile file admission, disposable sandboxing, and bounded multipart input;
- durable content-free administrator alerts;
- Response Note retention and receipt-gated deletion, including exceptional
  content-blind flood handling;
- physically and operationally separated role workstations and access paths;
- one consolidated, non-authorizing pre-code owner gate and a narrow inert
  Stage A implementation boundary.

No production-capable security workflow is enabled. The included Django code
is an inert scaffold plus deny-by-default interfaces and metadata-only domain
structures whose protected integrations remain gated.

The project owner approved `docs/25` through `docs/34` on 2026-08-26 and
authorized only the inert metadata-only Stage A. All independent, product,
production-equivalent, legal, operational, and release gates remain in force.
